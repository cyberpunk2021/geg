Grens:
The 1st number is number of fragments produced. 
The 2nd is the relative size of the fragments produced- the defensive like M26/M61 has larger chunks than the offensive likeRGN/РГН.
The 3rd and 4th are the radii (in meters) of the explosion and fragmentation killing zones respectively.
The 5th is relative power of the explosive - obviously, the concussive Mk3 has more raw explosive force than the fragmentation M26/M61.
The 6th and 7th are... something about shock and smoke?
The 8th and 9th are minumum and maximum delay fuze times respectively. The first two examples use the same type of fuze so they have anywhere from 4 to 6 seconds
until detonation.
