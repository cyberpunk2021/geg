04:19 - Xelat: about low velocity ammo, I'm 100% sure it's just not have modified speed, as it intended to use with silencer. If bullet speed is higher than or equal to 330 m/s, then bullet speed will be reduced up to 75% of original speed, related to silencing value. Can't find code about changing silencer damage, but will try to finally find now
04:23 - Xelat: found! Yes, resource will not be reduced for silencer, if bullet speed is lower than 330 m/s
04:24 - Xelat: oh, soeey
04:24 - Xelat: sorry
04:25 - Xelat: it will still decrease resource, there just different values
04:26 - Xelat: if bullet speed lower or equal to 330 m/s, then silencer will have x1 damage, if bullet speed between 330 and 800 m/s, then silender will have from x1 to x3 damage, or if bullet speed higher than 800 m/s, silencer will have x4 damage
04:32 - Xelat: about itemlevels.xml and shops, look this script examples http://pastebin.com/4BmMSri0 . actually it has a lot of uses in scripts, can't explain all of them. but basically it's just describe to which CGL item are related. As you understand - CGL 16 is a end-game content
04:32 - Xelat: > some shops pick items randomly from here?
yes, exactly! but if enabled in options






12:44 - Silveryte: yes, but you can already make bombs with them
12:46 - Silveryte: yeah not may ideas here
12:47 - Silveryte: how about the rpg itself
12:47 - Silveryte: like these tube ones
12:47 - UnloadingLeaf1: Oh, that's a great idea!
12:47 - UnloadingLeaf1: I think you can actually unload the ammo from those things.
12:47 - Silveryte: pretty cool
12:48 - Silveryte: nope
12:49 - Silveryte: so all these rpg rockets are deal
12:49 - Silveryte: and the tube launchers
12:49 - Silveryte: the grenade launcher ammo too
12:50 - Silveryte: the dynamite and all grenades ill do of course
12:50 - Silveryte: even the concussion one
12:50 - UnloadingLeaf1: Too bad it looks like it doesn't apply to smokes or flashbangs.
12:50 - Silveryte: yeah
12:50 - Silveryte: so lets see what else
12:51 - Silveryte: the whiskey box and wine crate
12:51 - Silveryte: anti tank ammo
12:51 - Silveryte: nails box
12:51 - Silveryte: tube launchers
12:52 - Silveryte: here is the vodka cane
12:53 - Silveryte: yeah i think these are the ones doable here
12:53 - Silveryte: and of course the kitchen gas cylinder
12:53 - Silveryte: which i need to find a model of
12:54 - UnloadingLeaf1: You can probably find those from Left 4 Dead.
12:54 - Silveryte: there should be some free since its a common object


========================

16:26 - Auspice: JA2 mods are shit ignore them
16:41 - Auspice: weapon types
semi or fully automatic rifle or pistol (worst)
bolt or lever action rifle (better)
machinegun (best)
revolver (even better than best)

quality types
very old quality no longer made, current guns are 30-40 years old or older (worst)
poor quality chinese/soviet russia/north korea/brazil/calico m200/famas f1/L85
normal quality service/military/most guns
higher quality AK/HK/similar service rifle, some civ guns maybe if the quality is better than service quality
highest quality premium guns/made for SF/top quality civ guns/modern sniper rifles (best)
16:41 - Auspice: this is as simple as I can get it
16:42 - Auspice: so like worst worst would be 2%
16:42 - Auspice: and top quality SF machineguns (probably don't exist) would be like 0.0001
16:43 - Auspice: like hm
16:43 - Silveryte: these are good guidelines
16:43 - Silveryte: we just need a range of values for these
16:43 - Auspice: yeah I'm thinking of a decent system
16:43 - Silveryte: what do you think of overheating in the game?
16:44 - Silveryte: is it ok right now?
16:44 - Auspice: idk
16:44 - Auspice: probably fine
16:44 - Auspice: just enough to be annoying
16:44 - Auspice: (not realistic but whatever)
16:45 - Auspice: so maybe something like this
16:45 - Auspice: semi/fully auto 0.002
16:45 - Auspice: bolt/lever 0.0015
16:45 - Auspice: machinegun 0.001
16:46 - Auspice: revolver 0
16:46 - Auspice: very old x10
16:46 - Auspice: poor x5
16:46 - Auspice: normal x1
16:46 - Auspice: higher * 0.2
16:46 - Auspice: highest * 0.1
16:46 - Auspice: maybe?
16:47 - Auspice: maybe that's too low for highest
16:47 - Auspice: and higher
16:47 - Auspice: maybe
16:47 - Auspice: x0.5
16:47 - Auspice: and x0.2
16:47 - Auspice: for higher and highest
16:48 - Auspice: (that's 1/2 and 1/5)
16:51 - Auspice: what do you think
16:54 - Silveryte: wait im looking at it
17:05 - Silveryte: yeah so
17:05 - Silveryte: its good
17:05 - Silveryte: so let me try to understand here
17:05 - Silveryte: so if i have for example
17:06 - Silveryte: a bolt action gun
17:06 - Silveryte: modern
17:06 - Silveryte: 0.0015 is the medium value, then i multiply for 0.1?
17:06 - Auspice: um
17:06 - Auspice: modern means x1
17:06 - Auspice: so 0.0015 would be the final battle
17:06 - Auspice: final
17:06 - Silveryte: sorry i forgot to say high quality
17:06 - Auspice: value
17:06 - Auspice: oh
17:06 - Auspice: well I think maybe
17:06 - Silveryte: highest
17:07 - Auspice: high quality should be x0.02
17:06 - Silveryte: so it stay 0,00015
17:07 - Auspice: and erm
17:07 - Auspice: highest should be x0.02
17:07 - Auspice: erm
17:07 - Auspice: .2
17:07 - Auspice: uh
17:07 - Auspice: so
17:07 - Auspice: old x10
17:07 - Auspice: bad x5
17:08 - Auspice: normal x1
17:08 - Auspice: better x0.5
17:08 - Auspice: best x0.2
17:08 - Auspice: (the x.2 and x.1 are too low imo)
17:10 - Silveryte: so we end it 0.0003
17:10 - Silveryte: for a modern higest bolt action
17:10 - Auspice: yeah
17:10 - Auspice: or a high quality civ bolt action rifle
17:10 - Silveryte: so for a mp18
17:11 - Silveryte: 0.002 * 10
17:11 - Auspice: 2%
17:11 - Silveryte: 0.02 = 2%
17:11 - Silveryte: cool
17:11 - Auspice: yeah
17:11 - Auspice: also
17:11 - Auspice: if you want
17:11 - Auspice: feel free to fiddle with things
17:12 - Auspice: although people can't see the values unless the gun is bad
17:12 - Silveryte: yeah
17:12 - Auspice: so there's not much reason to

Grens:
The 1st number is number of fragments produced. 
The 2nd is the relative size of the fragments produced- the defensive like M26/M61 has larger chunks than the offensive likeRGN/РГН.
The 3rd and 4th are the radii (in meters) of the explosion and fragmentation killing zones respectively.
The 5th is relative power of the explosive - obviously, the concussive Mk3 has more raw explosive force than the fragmentation M26/M61.
The 6th and 7th are... something about shock and smoke?
The 8th and 9th are minumum and maximum delay fuze times respectively. The first two examples use the same type of fuze so they have anywhere from 4 to 6 seconds
until detonation.

10:55 - Silveryte: hey there, all i need to set is so that weapons of caliber 22LR are always civilian, and shotguns with detachable magazine (magazine different from "built-in" return service
16:09 - Xelat: Hi. The check of weapon type divided into two separate functions. First determine weapon type at game startup for raw abstract item, and second function raise type for this weapon if some conditions met for item instance including attaches and etc.

So first question is where you want to add your rules? I think the second rule should be static and come into first function to define at startup time, and first rule vise versa. For static it's function 'buildItemLawType' in law.lua file. In code block with checks related to weapon default plugins add check for something like "if plugFamily == Family.ifClip and plugItem:IsBuiltIn() then return LawType.Special end". For runtime check for caliber add to function GetLawForItem check right after checking for Toy type, like "if itemInfo:GetCaliber() == "22LR" then return LawType.Civilian end".
16:12 - Xelat: ah, forget in first case add check for shotgun. then  "if weaponClass == wcShotgun and plugFamily == Family.ifClip and plugItem:IsBuiltIn() then return LawType.Special end"
16:12 - Xelat: also definitely you should move line "local weaponClass = info["Class"]" upper before cycle with plugs checks

Pistols, which bear incorrect inscription on the slide:

- All the huge Glock family. It is easier to say which of them marked correctly, than counting incorrect ones. Glock 27
is OK, and Glock 19 too. All the others clearly not.

- Imbel Xody pistol series are actually a Kimber Carry variations. Clearly visible their trademark logo on the slide, and, in addition, typical Kimber grip.

- Norinco NP-22.
- Norinco NP-34.
- Kahr K-40. Slide is marked as 9mm model.
- Norinco NP-58.
- Steyr MPi 69 has a horrible texture. Can it be changed? Model itself has high quality.
- Norinco NP-56 has SIG-Sauer markings.
- SIG-Sauer Mosquito has P226 markings. Which is incorrect, gentlemans.

!!! - SIG-Sauer P228, one of my favourites, is still way too big while in hands. That's a compact pistol, but ingame model are actually shares sizing with a full-sized P220! That's clearly a mistake. I have also noticed some ugly black stains on the model, which cannot be found on original The_Tub texture. Pistol require some retexture works, and i am nearly begging Silver to perform them. !!!

- 9x19mm PM-84P accepts 9x18 magazines. 9x19 magazines cannot be found in shops.
- Supressors has no their own unique icons. Plus, many of them mistakenly named; 9x19 variant, for example, called "trident" in the game, while the texture reads "gemtech". That's a common problem on many of them actually.
- Type 95 bayonet has no unique icon.
- Remington 11-87 has a transparent texture (take a closer look on the barrel).

More bugs to come. Hang on, boys and girls...

You also might be interested in this one: gamebanana.com/skins/142360

- Kahr K40 must be renowed, in my arrogant opinion. Slide clearly reads "K9", while K9 is a 9mm model. Same for chinese SIG-Sauer clones. That's a common problem with many handguns actually, i'll try to keep you all informed. Thanks for your attention.

- Imbel Xody pistol series are actually a Kimber Carry variations. Clearly visible their trademark logo on the slide, and, in addition, typical Kimber grip. 

A little note about the prices. You know, when some chinese SIG-Sauer clone has a higher price than a very, VERY pricy and high grade Kahr pistol - you know, that's just beyond. My suggest is this need to be changed.
